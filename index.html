Signal-based pipeline works differently — instead of broadcasting to a static list, you monitor behavioral triggers like job changes, funding events, hiring bursts, and tech installs. When a signal fires, an outreach sequence launches automatically. Era builds these systems for mid-market B2B companies and runs them continuously."

Signal-based outreach intercepts buyers at the moment of relevance. A prospect who just hired a VP of Sales or closed a Series B is in a fundamentally different state. Volume-based outreach hopes to catch them at the right time by accident."
